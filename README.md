# Frostbyte's Skip Server Movement Check

A server side mod that skips the client movement check that causes rubber-banding due to "moved too quickly" or "moved wrongly".
This means that client movement is not validated by the server, so server owners should be sure to only install this mod if they trust everyone to play fair.
