**Overview:**

A server side mod that skips the client movement check that causes rubber-banding due to "moved too quickly" or "moved wrongly".
This means that client movement is not validated by the server, so server owners should be sure to only install this mod if they trust everyone to play fair.

**FAQs:**

- _Will this be updated to 1.x.x?_ - Yes! I plan on updating this mod for as long as I can. Expect to wait a few weeks after major Minecraft updates for an updated version of this mod. There may be longer pauses between minor versions depending on how busy I am.
- _Will you make a Forge version?_ - No. I don't make Forge mods, but feel free to make your own (unofficial) port as long as you credit me for any code borrowed from this mod.
- _Can I use this in my mod pack?_ - Yes! I made this mod for people to use!
